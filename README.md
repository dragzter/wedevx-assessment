The fake login is admin/password. You can find the fake login in the upper right corner of the
home page.

I decided to make my own assets for this. I used figma to create a svg with a wave pattern. I
also made a fake company logo for this. The directions had some conflicting information. Text
asks for resume, but the mockup does not have a resume input. But the direcitons say to stick
to the mockup. I added a file input for the resume and I kept the layout of the app, but I added
my own design choices.

React is not my primary framework but I believe I have provided the required items. Thank you
for the opportunity to do this.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
